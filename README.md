## How to

Run `create-xdc.sh` to create your xdc file (unless you are a Windows user like me, then F, you'll have to manually create a zip with all files and rename the extension to `.xdc`)

The actual app is the `.xdc` file, you can modify the other ones and use the included [webxdc-dev](https://github.com/deltachat/webxdc-dev) to create a new app.

Just drop it into any chat and you should be able to test your math skills.
